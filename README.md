# microservices-mike
This repository contains my adventures in learning about microservices.  

## Tutorials
I am using Lucas Chen's tutorials about microservices, typescript, react, node.js, and graphql.  It is currently being hosted at Better Coding Academy - you can reach part one through the links section.  It is only up to part 11  and covers really only the user service and api gateway; hopefully he will keep working on it some more until it is complete.

## Blogs
I used Mike Herman's blogs on dockerization and various technologies, but could not get them to work correctly, I kept running into versioning and node issues with starting the service listeners.
